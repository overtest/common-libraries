[![Codeberg NuGet registry](https://badgen.net/badge/NuGet%20registry/Codeberg/#2185D0?icon=nuget)](https://codeberg.org/overtest/-/packages)

This repository contains various library projects (mainly written in `C#`), used by [Overtest](https://github.com/overtest) and its components. Note that these libraries are not intended to be used outside the Overtest ecosystem, so their APIs are very unstable and can be changed even in minor releases. If you want to use some of them in your own projects, we highly recommend you to create a fork of this repository and adapt it to your needs.

## Libraries & packages list
- [`overtest_task_models`](https://github.com/overtest/common-libraries/tree/main/overtest_task_models) â€” a [NuGet package](https://codeberg.org/overtest/-/packages/nuget/sirkadirov.overtest.common.taskmodels/) of a library containing models used to serialize and deserialize programming task projects for Overtest.

## How to install NuGet packages
**First step:** Add a [new NuGet source](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/usage/packages/nuget/) pointing to our [NuGet registry](https://codeberg.org/overtest/-/packages) at Codeberg. We use it instead of GitHub Packages because you don't need to be registered on Codeberg to access published packages, so it's easier to use.
```
dotnet nuget add source --name overtest https://codeberg.org/api/packages/overtest/nuget/index.json
```

**Second step:** Now you can install desired packages from our NuGet registry using built-in UI in your development environment or from the terminal using this command:
```
dotnet add package --source overtest --version <package version> <package name>
```
